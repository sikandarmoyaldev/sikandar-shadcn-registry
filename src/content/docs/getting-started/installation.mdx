description: How to install Sikandar Shadcn components in your project.

import CliCommandCode from "@/components/markdown/cli-command-code/cli-command-code.astro";
import { PUBLIC_SITE_SHORT_TITLE, PUBLIC_SITE_URL } from "astro:env/client";

It doesn't matter what framework or package manager you are using. Installing {PUBLIC_SITE_SHORT_TITLE} Shadcn components is as simple as running the `shadcn add` command followed by the URL to the component you want to install. This URL will always be formatted as <code>{PUBLIC_SITE_URL}/r/\<component-name\>.json</code>.

The entire install process is handled by the `shadcn` CLI tool and works identically to how you would install any other Shadcn component.

## Example

<CliCommandCode
    action="run"
    command={`shadcn@latest add ${PUBLIC_SITE_URL}/r/password-input.json`}
/>
